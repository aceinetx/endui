# endui
A sequel to TWn, completely rewritten
## Why rewrite?
- TWn had many bugs and crashes
- I wanted to rewrite it completely with C (maybe c3) for more speed
- I wanted to use CMake as a build system to make testing and cross-platforming easier
<br>
EndUI will be tested on as many platforms as possible to avoid all bugs
<br>
sssh... wait until I push the source, something big is coming up
